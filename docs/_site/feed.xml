&lt;h3 id=&quot;integration&quot;&gt;Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by creating a new exercise instead of changing the existing exercise because this will not break any code whatsoever. Once the exercise template was added I started by adding the Lincoln Mkz package to the RADI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car was imported but the plugins and functional elements were not working, most of the time was taken up for getting the plugins setup right, once the plugins were settled the car could be imported directly into gzweb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tasks&quot;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Improve Documentation in Robotics Academy for Developers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the development of the car model has taken place in urdf and xacro, but the current state of car junction exercise is in sdf, so migrating all these files under a single roof will pave a way to implement remaining exercises as well. The coming weekâ€™s task will be more focussed towards this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">To kick off week 11 of the coding period We discussed at the beginning of the week to start integrating the car model into Robotics Academyâ€™s Exercises.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3d-lidar-&quot;&gt;3D Lidar âš¡&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 3D Lidar has been added to the car model, which can now be accessed as a 3-dimensional array, which the user can go on to narrow down as per their Field of View requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gps-sensor-&quot;&gt;The GPS Sensor ðŸš—&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an addition to the existing Sensors, we have also decided to add a GPS Sensor. This can later be used to create future exercises. The GPS follows the earth model, 1 degree of latitude is 60 arc minutes with one arc minute being up to 1.82 kilometers. Hence, a movement of a few meters will be only a tiny fraction of a degree of latitude or longitude. Hence the user will also need to multiply a proportional constant to the GPS Coordinates to track or notice changes during minute car travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tasks&quot;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2d-lidar-&quot;&gt;2D Lidar âš¡&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar is a very important technology in a self-driving car and to enable the Lincoln Mkz to be one, a lidar must be included. The lidar has been placed at the front of the vehicle with 180 degrees view of the surroundings, due to the physical nature of the simulation the lidar cannot be used for a 360 degrees scan. This can be solved by a 3D lidar in the future implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ford-flavor-&quot;&gt;The Ford Flavor ðŸš—&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an addition to the lineup of the Car models we have decided to add the Ford Model, one that actually pupil can recognise and are familiar with. The model was chosen as it was the best fit on the existing structure of the Ackermann model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-camera-module-lag-&quot;&gt;The Camera module lag ðŸ˜”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A camera module is very important to a self-driving car and whatâ€™s more important is a latency-free camera module. I started by adding a camera module to the Lincoln Mkz and what resulted was a very good quality codec output but what followed was the latency in frames received. This latency could cause a delay in actions performed by the car and that will take a huge toll on the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to decrease this latency is to compress the images and have a specific topic publish the compressed frames, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.ros.org/compressed_image_transport&quot;&gt;Compressed_image_transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; package is one such package which does this job well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After compressing the camera images the latency issue is solved ðŸ˜Š.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-i-upgrade-the-textures&quot;&gt;How did I upgrade the Textures?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s very important for a simulation model to look realistic, a realistic model is what encourages anyone to code in a simulation mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by adding and testing out different color and textures to the car model in &lt;strong&gt;Fusion 360&lt;/strong&gt; and it was a big mistake as I realized fusion 360 does not export colors when exported as urdf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little research I found out that &lt;strong&gt;Blender&lt;/strong&gt; is one such tool where this does not happen, so I applied all the changes I previously made inside blender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Car is as good as it gets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tasks&quot;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-what-went-wrong-&quot;&gt;So what went wrong ðŸ˜”?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The packages and hybrid plugins of the Toyota Car were never maintained after the ROSCON â€˜17 Event, this was the time ROS as a framework had most changes to it. ROS Kinetic, which the Toyota Car was presented with went on to become ROS Melodic and then the currently used version to develop this project i.e ROS Noetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so to bring the Toyota Car to life a lot of dependencies and plugins had to be changed, when a dependency is changed the underlying code still remains the same and just uses the updated dependency to compile the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the problem in the case of our Toyota car model, well coming so far from a model that doesnâ€™t work, I wasnâ€™t going to leave it without a try. I geared up to solve all the errors the package had. Started from changing message types, plugins to joint state publishers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QT4 THE DEAD END ðŸ›‘â€¦&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying code had a QT4 dependency, one way of going about it is to assume none of the changes after QT5 would break the existing code. I started by changing the requirement dependency and the code did not compile, this only meant changing 100s of lines of code and adding to that was the missing QtCreator Docs that were needed for migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It meant only one thing, coming up with a new model, while I was at this there was always a Plan B. It was the &lt;strong&gt;Lincoln MKZ Model&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things were quite straight forward from here, working with the Totota Car Model made it easy to deal with the Lincoln MKZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tasks&quot;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Create a New Car Model.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Car Model should have Ackermann Physics with movable and turnable wheels replicating a real world car.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it took a lot of time in making this possible the Lincoln MKZ model is sharp at looks and has even better physics compared to the Toyota Prius Model. It definitely stands as an upgrade to the Toyota Prius Model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tasks&quot;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Build a Toyota Car model with Ackermann Physics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Toyota Car packages of the models and their plugins being incompatible with Gazebo11, I was able get the basic forward and backward functionatlity just right, the Ackermann steering still needs quite a bit of workaround with ROS noetic to enable the Car to move in left and right directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the Ackermann steering at this scale on a Toy Car helps in the implementation of Ackermann steering in the upcoming weeks on a large scale version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gazebo 11 plugins have majorly been explored, and the 3d lidar packages like Velodyne which generates a point cloud have been implemented. The [Ackermann Steering] (https://wiki.ros.org/action/fullsearch/ackermann_steering_controller) package which can be used on custom gazebo models has been explored. This package can be used at a later stage to add Ackermann steering to the call models.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Akshay Narisetti</name></author><summary type="html">To kick off week 2 of the community bonding period We discussed at the beginning of the week to continue exploring the car models part of the Codebase while also exploring the Ackermann steering and packages that will help in the implementation of 3d Lidar on the car models.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Community Bonding - Week 1</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/gsoc2022-Akshay_Narisetti/2022/05/30/community-bonding-week-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Community Bonding - Week 1" /><published>2022-05-30T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-05-30T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/gsoc2022-Akshay_Narisetti/2022/05/30/community-bonding-week-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/gsoc2022-Akshay_Narisetti/2022/05/30/community-bonding-week-1.html">&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m excited to be working with JdeRobot community on the RoboticsAcademy project!. Google Summer of Code starts off with a community bonding period where we get familiar with the community and also explore the project to get a better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a discussion at the beginning of the week about how to go about the project and the first steps to do.&lt;/p&gt;
