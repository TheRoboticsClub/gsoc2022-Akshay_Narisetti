<p>The packages and hybrid plugins of the Toyota Car were never maintained after the ROSCON â€˜17 Event, this was the time ROS as a framework had most changes to it.

<p><strong>QT4 THE DEAD END ðŸ›‘â€¦</strong></p>

<p>The underlying code had a QT4 dependency, one way of going about it is to assume none of the changes after QT5 would break the existing code. I started by changing the requirement dependency and the code did not compile, this only meant changing 100s of lines of code and adding to that was the missing QtCreator Docs that were needed for migration.</p>

<p>It meant only one thing, coming up with a new model, while I was at this there was always a Plan B. It was the <strong>Lincoln MKZ Model</strong>.</p>

<p>Things were quite straight forward from here, working with the Totota Car Model made it easy to deal with the Lincoln MKZ.</p>

<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>
<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Create a New Car Model.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Car Model should have Ackermann Physics with movable and turnable wheels replicating a real world car.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Modular code to add Sensors in future.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Although it took a lot of time in making this possible the Lincoln MKZ model is sharp at looks and has even better physics compared to the Toyota Prius Model. It definitely stands as an upgrade to the Toyota Prius Model.</p>
