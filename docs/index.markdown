excerpt: 
  Improvement of Autonomous Driving Exercises
---


Robotics-Academy is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It consists of a collection of robot programming exercises. The students have to code in Python the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision. It uses standard middleware and libraries such as ROS or openCV.

Currently there are four exercises regarding autonomous driving exercises in RoboticsAcademy:
<ol>
<li>Local Navigation</li>
<li>Global Navigation</li>
<li>Autoparking</li>
<li>Car Junction</li>
</ol>

The requirements of the project are:

<ul>
  <li>Creation of several realistic car models with Ackermann control some of them including a 3D LIDAR.</li>
  <li>Improved Realistic and Lightweight Environments for Autonomous Driving Exercises in RoboticsAcademy.</li>
  <li>Migration of existing Autonomous Driving Exercises into ROS2 at RoboticsAcademy.</li>
</ul>
