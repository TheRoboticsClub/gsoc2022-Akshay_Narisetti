Before actually going ahead and building the Ackermann steering on the real-world car it was important to implement it at a low scale i.e on a toy car, this checks out as a proof-of-concept for the upcoming weeks.


### Tasks
- [x] Create Ackermann Steering on a Toy Car.
- [x] Convert linear and angular messages into Ackermann steering messages used by the [Ackermann Steering Package](https://wiki.ros.org/action/fullsearch/ackermann_steering_controller).


## Conclusions
The implementation of the Ackermann steering at this scale on a Toy Car helps in the implementation of Ackermann steering in the upcoming weeks on a large scale version.
