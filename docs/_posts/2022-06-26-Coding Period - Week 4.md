We had a discussion at the beginning of the week, the task at hand was to get a realistic Toyota Car running inside ROS and Gazebo with Ackermann physics.

### Tasks
- [x] Build a Toyota Car model with Ackermann Physics.


## Conclusions
Most Toyota Car packages of the models and their plugins being incompatible with Gazebo11, I was able get the basic forward and backward functionatlity just right, the Ackermann steering still needs quite a bit of workaround with ROS noetic to enable the Car to move in left and right directions.
