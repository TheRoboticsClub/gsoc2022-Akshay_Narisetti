I'm excited to be working with JdeRobot community on the RoboticsAcademy project!. Google Summer of Code starts off with a community bonding period where we get familiar with the community and also explore the project to get a better understanding.


We had a discussion at the beginning of the week about how to go about the project and the first steps to do.

### Tasks
- [x] Setup a blogging website to write about the progress of GSOC project.
- [x] Exploring Django side of RoboticsAcademy project.

This [repository](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/gsoc2022-akshay_narisetti) will be used for all the code developed as well as the blog website. The blog website is written using jekyll based on the template 'minimal-mistakes'

## Conclusions

I have successfully created a blogging website to document my GSoC 2022 Journey and logs, explored and gained deep understanding of Django side of RoboticsAcademy Project.
